A simple plugin for WordPress that integrates a blog with popular social 
networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

== Description ==

The Zolton.org Social Plugin (ZOSP) is a simple plugin for WordPress that 
integrates a blog with popular social networking sites such as Facebook and 
Twitter. I wrote this plugin to learn WordPress plugin development, and as a 
means to decouple these social networking features from my desired WordPress 
theme.

Features

* Includes the Facebook JavaScript SDK in your WordPress theme.
* Generates Facebook Open Graph tags for posts and pages.
* Includes the Facebook Like Button and Send Button on posts and pages.
* Imports the featured image / post thumbnail (if available) from a post or 
page for use as the featured image on Facebook.
* Generates a Facebook Comment section for posts and pages.
* Includes the Twitter Tweet Button on posts and pages.
* Includes the Google +1 Button on posts and pages.
* Includes the Pinterest Pin It Button on posts and pages.
* Optionally hides Wordpress comments.
* Configurable via Wordpress setting page.

Requirements

* A Facebook App ID.
* A Twitter account.
* WordPress theme supporting featured images / post thumbnails.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1. Activate the plugin via the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
1. Edit the "Required Settings" via the "Settings / Social Plugin" menu in Wordpress.
At the very least, you need to specify a Facebook App ID and a Twitter username.
1. Optionally edit the "Advanced Settings" via the "Settings / Social Plugin" menu in Wordpress.
1. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Facebook Comments display the error "Warning: http://somesite.com/somepage/ is unreachable". =
Try using Facebook's [URL Linter](http://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/) 
to see if the URL for the page in question generates any errors.

= The Pinterest Pin It button does not display despite the fact that it is configured to do so. =
The Pinterest Pin It button requires that the post or page include a featured image. Check your 
post or page to ensure that a featured image is set.
